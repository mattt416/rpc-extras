upgrade:
  - The `elasticsearch-upgrade-pre.yml` play takes care
    of upgrading the legacy elasticsearch data and preparing
    the cluster for the upgrade of the elasticsearch packages.
    Due to some inconsistencies in the legacy elasticsearch
    mappings it is necessary to reindex all elasticsearch
    data into indices with the updated 2.x compatible mappings.
    Included with the upgrade tasks is a python wrapper to
    monitor and control the reindexing process.  It is
    recomended to reindex all indices prior to the current
    day before beginning the upgrade.  Please check the upgrade
    documentation for more information on how to reindex the
    existing elasticsearch indices.
